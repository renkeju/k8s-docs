# 3.2.4 资源配置清单格式文档

定义资源配置清单时，监管apiVersion、kind 和 metadata 都有章可循，但 spec 字段对不同的资源来说确是千差万别的，因此用户需要参考Kubernetes API的参考文档来了解各种可用属性字段。好在，Kubernetes 在系统上内建了相关的文档，用户可以使用 “kubectl explain” 命令直接获取相关的使用帮助，它将根据给出的对象类型或相应的嵌套字段来显示相关的下一级文档。例如，要了解Pod资源的一级字段，可以使用类似如下的命令，命令结果会输出支持使用的各一组字段及其说明：

```
**[terminal]
**[delimiter $ ]**[command kubectl explain pods]
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is
     created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind	<string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata	<Object>
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata

   spec	<Object>
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

   status	<Object>
     Most recently observed status of the pod. This data may not be up to date.
     Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

```

需要了解某一字段表示的对象之下的二级对象字段时，只需要指定其一级字段的对象名称即可，三级和四级字段对象等的查看方式以此类推。例如查看Pod资源的Spec对象支持嵌套使用的二级字段，可使用类似如下的命令：

```
**[terminal]
**[delimiter $ ]**[command kubectl explain pods.spec]
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

     PodSpec is a description of a pod.

FIELDS:
   activeDeadlineSeconds	<integer>
     Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to
     StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill
     associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.

   affinity	<Object>
     If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints

   automountServiceAccountToken	<boolean>
     AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token
     should be automatically mounted.

   containers	<[]Object> -required-
     List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
     added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
     updated.

   dnsConfig	<Object>
     Specifies the DNS parameters of a pod. Parameters specified here will be
     merged to the generated DNS configuration based on DNSPolicy.

   dnsPolicy	<string>
     Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to "ClusterFirst". Valid values are
     'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS
     parameters given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with
     DNSPolicy. To have DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to
     specify DNS policy explicitly to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.

   enableServiceLinks	<boolean>
     EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be
     injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker
     links. Optional: Defaults to true.

   hostAliases	<[]Object>
     HostAliases is an optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into
     the pod's hosts file if specified. This is only valid for non-hostNetwork
     pods.

   hostIPC	<boolean>
     Use the host's ipc namespace. Optional: Default to false.

   hostNetwork	<boolean>
     Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace.
     If this option is set, the ports that will be used must be specified.
     Default to false.

   hostPID	<boolean>
     Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.

   hostname	<string>
     Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will
     be set to a system-defined value.

   imagePullSecrets	<[]Object>
     ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same
     namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If
     specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller
     implementations for them to use. For example, in the case of docker, only
     DockerConfig type secrets are honored. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod

   initContainers	<[]Object>
     List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are
     executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container
     fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its
     restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
     unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle
     actions, Readiness probes, or Liveness probes. The resourceRequirements of
     an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the
     highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of
     that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init
     containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added
     or removed. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/

   nodeName	<string>
     NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is
     non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming
     that it fits resource requirements.

   nodeSelector	<map[string]string>
     NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node.
     Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on
     that node. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/

   priority	<integer>
     The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
     priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it
     prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates
     this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the
     priority.

   priorityClassName	<string>
     If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and
     "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the
     highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other
     name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If
     not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no
     default.

   readinessGates	<[]Object>
     If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A
     pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified
     in the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/0007-pod-ready%2B%2B.md

   restartPolicy	<string>
     Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure,
     Never. Default to Always. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy

   runtimeClassName	<string>
     RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group,
     which should be used to run this pod. If no RuntimeClass resource matches
     the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy"
     RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty
     definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is an
     alpha feature and may change in the future.

   schedulerName	<string>
     If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not
     specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.

   securityContext	<Object>
     SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container
     settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default
     values of each field.

   serviceAccount	<string>
     DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName.
     Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.

   serviceAccountName	<string>
     ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this
     pod. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/

   shareProcessNamespace	<boolean>
     Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod.
     When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from
     other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container
     will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both
     be set. Optional: Default to false. This field is beta-level and may be
     disabled with the PodShareProcessNamespace feature.

   subdomain	<string>
     If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be
     "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not
     specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.

   terminationGracePeriodSeconds	<integer>
     Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be
     decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value
     zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace
     period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds
     after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and
     the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set
     this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults
     to 30 seconds.

   tolerations	<[]Object>
     If specified, the pod's tolerations.

   volumes	<[]Object>
     List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod.
     More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes

```

对象的spec字段的文档通常包含RESOURCE、DESCRIPTION和FILEDS几节，其中FILEDS节中给出了可嵌套使用的字段、数据类型及功能描述。例如，上面命令的结果显示在FILEDS中的containers字段的数据类型是一个对象列表（[]Object），而且是一个必选字段。任何值为对象类型数据的字段都会嵌套一到多个下一级字段，例如，Pod对象中的每个容器也是对象类型数据，它同样包含嵌套字段，但容器不支持单独创建，而是要包含于Pod对象的上下文中，其详细信息可通过三级字段来获取，命令及其结果示例如下：

```
**[terminal]
**[delimiter $ ]**[command kubectl explain pods.spec.containers]
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: containers <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
     added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
     updated.

     A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

FIELDS:
   args	<[]string>
     Arguments to the entrypoint. The docker image's CMD is used if this is not
     provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the
     container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in
     the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped
     with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be
     expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be
     updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

   command	<[]string>
     Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The docker image's
     ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME)
     are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be
     resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The
     $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME).
     Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the
     variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

   env	<[]Object>
     List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.

   envFrom	<[]Object>
     List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The
     keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will
     be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists
     in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take
     precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take
     precedence. Cannot be updated.

   image	<string>
     Docker image name. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is
     optional to allow higher level config management to default or override
     container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

   imagePullPolicy	<string>
     Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always
     if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.
     More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

   lifecycle	<Object>
     Actions that the management system should take in response to container
     lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.

   livenessProbe	<Object>
     Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the
     probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

   name	<string> -required-
     Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod
     must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.

   ports	<[]Object>
     List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the
     system additional information about the network connections a container
     uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT
     prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the
     default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the
     network. Cannot be updated.

   readinessProbe	<Object>
     Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed
     from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

   resources	<Object>
     Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/

   securityContext	<Object>
     Security options the pod should run with. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/ More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

   stdin	<boolean>
     Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
     runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always
     result in EOF. Default is false.

   stdinOnce	<boolean>
     Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has
     been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will
     remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true,
     stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client
     attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client
     disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the
     container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that
     reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

   terminationMessagePath	<string>
     Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination
     message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message
     written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure
     message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The
     total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb.
     Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.

   terminationMessagePolicy	<string>
     Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the
     contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message
     on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk
     of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the
     container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or
     80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.

   tty	<boolean>
     Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires
     'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

   volumeDevices	<[]Object>
     volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
     This is a beta feature.

   volumeMounts	<[]Object>
     Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.

   workingDir	<string>
     Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
     default will be used, which might be configured in the container image.
     Cannot be updated.

```

内建文档大大降低了用户手动创建资源配置清单的难度，尝试使用某个资源类型时，explain也的确是用户常用的命令之一。熟悉各常用字段的功能之后，以同类型的现有活动对象的清单为模板可以更快地生成目标资源的配置文件，命令格式为“kubectl get TYPENAME -o yaml --export”，其中 --export 选项用于省略输出由系统生成的信息。例如，基于现在的 Deployment 资源对象 myapp 生成配置模板 deploy-demo.yaml 文件，可以使用如下命令：

```
**[terminal]
**[delimiter $ ]**[command kubectl get deployment myapp -o yaml --export > deploy-demo.yaml]
```

通过资源清单文件管理资源对象较之直接通过命令操作有着诸多优势，具体包括命令行的操作方式仅支持部分资源对象的部分属性，而资源清单支持配置资源的所有属性字段，而且使用配置清单文件还能够进行版本追踪、复审等高级功能的操作。本书后续章节中的大部分资源管理操作都会借助资源配置文件进行。
